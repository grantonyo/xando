# xando

## General
This is a tic-tac-toe console game.
Developed by grantonyo as a homework at Skillfactory courses.

## How to make a turn
Player 1 always makes the first turn and starts with putting "x' to the board.
To make a turn, players must add coordinates of the respective cell to the console (e.g. "b1") and press 'enter' button then.
Coordinates must always be indicated by adding English letter 'a', 'b' or 'c' (in a lower case) as a first letter and '1', '2' or '3' as a second letter. 

## Rules
Player 1 adds 'x's to the cells in its turn. Player 2 adds 'o's to the cells in its turn. Only one value can be added per one turn.
The player that manages to put 3 'x's or 3'o's in a row, in a column or in a diagonal wins.
Otherwise game ends when there are no more empty cells.
